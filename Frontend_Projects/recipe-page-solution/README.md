### What I learned

Through this project heres the few things i learned:
- **Make a Website Responsite**: Making a website flexable for every device was a challage. Where i never knew much about responsive design. Revewing through W3schools article helped me to understand how to design an responsite project.
- **Desinging Lists with CSS positioning**: I learned better use of positioning by creating list without using ```<ul>``` and ```<ol>``` tag.
